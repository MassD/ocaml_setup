How to use ocamlbuild + ocamlfind

Tell ocamlbuild to use batteries through a _tags file: <*>: package(batteries)
Use open Batteries in your source files to allow referring to BatFoo as just Foo. This also integrates BatList and all other stdlib-extensions into the standard module names.
Compile with ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind foo.byte where foo.ml is the name of your main module file. (or foo.native for native compilation)

_tags is a file and you can create it in the same folder of your main.
inside the _tags, you can write <*>: package(package_name).
then the command will be **ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind hello.native**

ps. camomile is the package name of camomile.
